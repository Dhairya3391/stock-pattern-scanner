# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to modernize and improve the existing stock pattern scanner by removing unnecessary complexity, fixing pattern detection logic, and implementing a robust machine learning approach using pre-trained models optimized for MacBook performance. The system will follow established technical analysis principles from authoritative trading books and implement state-of-the-art pattern recognition techniques.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a clean and efficient stock pattern scanner that removes unnecessary code and complexity, so that I can focus on accurate pattern detection without system bloat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is refactored THEN all redundant code, unused imports, and duplicate functionality SHALL be removed
2. WHEN the codebase is cleaned THEN the file size SHALL be reduced by at least 40% while maintaining all core functionality
3. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL have improved performance with faster loading times and reduced memory usage
4. WHEN patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL use a single, optimized detection pipeline instead of multiple competing approaches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want pattern detection logic that follows established technical analysis principles from authoritative trading books, so that I can trust the accuracy of detected patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Head and Shoulders patterns are detected THEN the logic SHALL follow the criteria from "Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets" by John Murphy
2. WHEN Double Top/Bottom patterns are detected THEN the validation SHALL include proper volume confirmation and neckline analysis
3. WHEN Cup and Handle patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL validate cup depth, handle formation, and breakout volume as per William O'Neil's methodology
4. WHEN Triangle patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL properly identify ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles with volume analysis
5. WHEN any pattern is detected THEN the system SHALL calculate proper target prices using measured move techniques

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with a MacBook, I want the system to use a high-quality pre-trained model optimized for Apple Silicon, so that I can benefit from fast and accurate ML-based pattern recognition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load a pre-trained model optimized for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 chips)
2. WHEN pattern detection runs THEN the ML model SHALL use Core ML or optimized PyTorch/TensorFlow for maximum performance
3. WHEN processing stock data THEN the system SHALL leverage GPU acceleration when available on MacBook
4. WHEN the model makes predictions THEN it SHALL provide confidence scores above 85% accuracy for known patterns
5. WHEN multiple stocks are scanned THEN the system SHALL utilize parallel processing optimized for MacBook architecture

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want advanced pattern detection techniques that combine traditional technical analysis with modern ML approaches, so that I can identify patterns with higher accuracy and fewer false positives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL use both traditional rule-based detection and ML-based validation
2. WHEN volume analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL implement On-Balance Volume (OBV) and Volume Price Trend (VPT) indicators
3. WHEN pattern confirmation is needed THEN the system SHALL use multiple timeframe analysis for validation
4. WHEN false positives are detected THEN the system SHALL use ensemble methods to filter out low-quality patterns
5. WHEN pattern strength is calculated THEN the system SHALL incorporate momentum indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic) for confirmation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use modern Python libraries and best practices, so that the codebase is maintainable and can leverage the latest ML advancements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is rebuilt THEN it SHALL use the latest versions of pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn
2. WHEN ML models are implemented THEN the system SHALL use Hugging Face Transformers or similar for pre-trained models
3. WHEN data processing occurs THEN the system SHALL use vectorized operations and efficient data structures
4. WHEN the code is structured THEN it SHALL follow clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns
5. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use a modern package manager with locked versions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive pattern validation that includes breakout confirmation and target price calculation, so that I can make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pattern is detected THEN the system SHALL validate breakout with volume confirmation
2. WHEN target prices are calculated THEN the system SHALL use multiple methods (measured move, Fibonacci extensions, support/resistance levels)
3. WHEN pattern reliability is assessed THEN the system SHALL consider historical success rates for similar patterns
4. WHEN risk assessment is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate stop-loss levels based on pattern structure
5. WHEN pattern status is reported THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate whether patterns are forming, confirmed, or failed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface that clearly displays detected patterns with visual indicators and confidence scores, so that I can quickly assess trading opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN patterns are displayed THEN the interface SHALL show clear visual markers on price charts
2. WHEN pattern information is presented THEN it SHALL include confidence scores, target prices, and stop-loss levels
3. WHEN multiple patterns are found THEN the system SHALL rank them by reliability and potential profit
4. WHEN pattern details are viewed THEN the system SHALL provide educational information about each pattern type
5. WHEN scanning results are shown THEN the interface SHALL allow filtering by pattern type, confidence level, and timeframe
